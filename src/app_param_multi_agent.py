# To run: In the current folder: 
# python app_param_multi_agent.py

# This example is a sample that create an agent which helps
# check tire inventory and calculate the sale price of tires. 
# This agent has three tools, one math tool, one checks inventory,
# one fetches tire price. In this demo, price/inventory tools give 
# hard coded responses, however, we can use API tool, 
# SQL tool and even chain tool to 
# customize it for real business logic. 
#
# Please note price tool takes one string as input, and inventory tool
# takes two parameters. That's why we need an agent whose
# type is STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION
#
# The backend of llmchain uses OpenAI gpt3.5 chat model which is not a correct approach
# Example response. The answer varys every time, with or without prompt optimization
